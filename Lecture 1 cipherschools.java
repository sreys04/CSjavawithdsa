Objects:-
     
 An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.

An object has three characteristics:
    1. State: represents the data (value) of an object.
    2. Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an        object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
    3. Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. 


Classes:-

 A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:

1. Fields
2. Methods
3. Constructors
4. Blocks
5. Nested class and interface
