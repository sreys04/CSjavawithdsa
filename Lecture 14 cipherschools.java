Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

In Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class.

 Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java.

 Like C/C++, we can also create single dimentional or multidimentional arrays in Java.
